# `Soulkan`

A **powerful** and **concise** library for **simplifying** [Vulkan](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers) and its quirks !


# Features

- The more secure [vulkan.hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) bindings
- Error communication to the users with the `SkResult` struct template and its related function templates
- A very simple memory allocator

# Goals
- Simplifying the Vulkan API 

## `SkResult` and its related functions

- SkResult works as a very lightweight wrapper around function returns to force error catching.
