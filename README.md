# `Soulkan`

A **powerful** and **concise** library for **simplifying** [Vulkan](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Headers) and its quirks !
Write a working Hello Triangle program in **under 250 lines**, comments included !
Here, **API** stands for **Abridged Programming Interface** !


# Features

- The more secure [vulkan.hpp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp) bindings
- Basic window management with GLFW

# Goals
- **Simplifying** the Vulkan API
- Making it easier to use **without sacrificing details**
- Improving program **readability**, *a programmer not versed in 3D/GPU Programming should be able to understand what the code does*
